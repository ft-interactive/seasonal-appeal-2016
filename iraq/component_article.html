    <div class="block heading-block"><h3>Yemen: the forgotten war</h3></div><div class="block text-block"><p>Dr Zhihao Oon’s idea of hospital care used to be based on his work at King’s College London, where he had state-of-the-art equipment and anaesthetic creams to rub into children’s hands to numb the prick of a needle.  </p>
<p>All that changed this spring. Instead of being at a world-leading research university, he was sitting in a truck rumbling up a dirt road towards a remote town near the front line in Yemen, a country torn apart by one of the world’s lesser known wars.  </p>
<p>When Dr Oon spent three months volunteering with Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, a non-governmental organisation, his new hospital in the northwestern rural town of Abs was surrounded by displaced families living in dusty tents. Patients quietly withstood the pain of whatever treatment they could get.  </p>
<p>“If we needed blood, we asked relatives to stick out their arm,” Dr Oon recalls. “People were quite used to suffering. They were just so grateful to be treated for free. They felt abandoned by the other [aid agencies].”  </p>
<p>This is a time of huge humanitarian need across the globe. More than 125m people were affected by conflict or disaster this year. The five-year civil war in Syria has generated the biggest refugee crisis since 1945, sending hundreds of thousands of people <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/EU_immigration" target="_blank">towards Europe’s shores</a>. Millions more are trapped in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6d17376-906e-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78" target="_blank">conflict zones like Yemen.</a>  </p>
<p>Yet fewer humanitarian organisations are helping in the places where they are needed most. Many aid groups have become risk averse, limiting the exposure of their staff to conflicts. At the same time, the international community appears less able — or less willing — to stop the violence that ravages not only the victims of war but the organisations trying to help them.  </p>
<p>For this year’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/seasonal-appeal-2016" target="_blank">seasonal appeal</a>, the Financial Times has partnered with MSF, which has projects in nearly 70 countries. The agency sends in <a href="https://secure.msf.org.uk/Donate/MultiLanding.aspx?source=7422&amp;country=000" target="_blank">funds</a> and supplies but is also one of the few aid organisations to put its own people’s lives on the line.  </p></div><div class="block media-block media-block-image">

</div><div class="block text-block"><p>Founded in France by volunteer medics and journalists in 1971, MSF’s work is based on the belief that every person has the right to medical care, regardless of their beliefs, ethnicity or background. Those medical needs, it says, are more important than any national border. It is a principle that pushes MSF to go where many other NGOs will not and inspires volunteers like anaesthesiologist Dr Oon.  </p>
<p>This commitment to impartiality challenges the group’s work to this day: warring sides are suspicious of its open acknowledgment that it will treat any patient who comes its way.  </p></div><div class="block media-block media-block-video">

</div><div class="block text-block"><p>In the past year, 75 MSF-supported hospitals have been bombed, in what the group calls an “epidemic of attacks”. The most dramatic incident MSF has faced was the October 2015 <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddc5f662-0e26-11e6-ad80-67655613c2d6" target="_blank">US air strike on its medical centre</a> in Kunduz, Afghanistan, which killed 42 people and destroyed the facility.  </p>
<p>“We often have this feeling of ‘where is everybody?’” says Will Turner, head of the MSF mission in Yemen.  </p>
<p>Studies suggest that more than half of Yemen’s 24m people do not know where their next meal will come from, and 370,000 children are malnourished. MSF doctors have treated skeletal 12-year-olds weighing less than 20kg (44lb).  </p>
<p>“What we really need in Yemen now is a greater scale-up of organisations and a presence in these hardest-hit areas, because this is where you need to have direct interaction with authorities to negotiate for access to deliver your assistance,” Mr Turner says.  </p></div><div class="block media-block media-block-image">

In places like Yemen, where al-Qaeda insurgents still operate, it means the group has enough local support to bring in foreign medics like Dr Oon.  </p>
<p>Before his visit, Dr Oon, 36, had never been to the Middle East. In Yemen, an intervention by a Saudi-led coalition — which backs the internationally recognised government but has been accused of indiscriminate air attacks — has taken the fight to Shia Houthi rebels who control large areas of the country including the capital Sanaa. Dr Oon’s only experience of an environment like a war zone had been in a simulation during national service with the army in his native Singapore.  </p>
<p>He has learnt some Arabic on the job: enough to ask patients their age and where their pain is. “The moment a patient comes in, they are not a rebel or a Houthi, they are not al-Qaeda, they are not a Saudi, or whatever. They are a person — a patient,” says Dr Oon. “They have a heart. They have blood. They feel pain. They have emotions. They have a family. The hospital is a place for healing. It is sacred in that respect.”  </p></div><div class="block media-block media-block-image">

</div><div class="block text-block"><p>MSF is one of the few aid agencies willing to publicly criticise governments and international institutions like the UN, which it says is slow, bureaucratic and cautious in its response to emergencies.  </p>
<p>The group has been critical of its peers in the aid world, too, arguing that their dependence on major donors and government agencies, such as the UK Department for International Development or the US Agency for International Development, makes them cumbersome and could affect their neutrality.  </p>
<p>This year, MSF UK decided to stop seeking funding from EU institutions, making it wholly reliant on private donations. The decision was driven by Europe’s refugee deterrence policies, says Vickie Hawkins, executive director.  </p>
<p>“We simply cannot accept such funding while at the same time treating the victims of those policies,” she said. “It means that now, more than ever, we rely on the support of the public to continue providing life-saving medical care.”  </p></div><div class="block media-block media-block-image">

But the group does draw criticism. Whereas some aid organisations will speak out against a regime at the cost of losing access to those in need, MSF has negotiated with governments and militias accused of human rights abuses in order to stay on the ground.  </p>
<p>Among the critics has been MSF itself: it exposed the questionable dealings of both MSF and other aid groups in 2011 when it published a report called <a href="http://www.msf-crash.org/livres/en/humanitarian-negotiations-revealed" target="_blank">Humanitarian Negotiations Revealed</a>, which disclosed how it paid the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab organisation $10,000 a project to continue its work in Somalia.

<p>Dr Mohammed worked for five months in Mosul under the jihadi group’s rule, and lived in fear of it before he and his wife escaped.
